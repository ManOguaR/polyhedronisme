polyHÃ©dronisme
===============

This is a project built to demonstrate the
[Conway Polyhedral Operators][1] and their extensions by
[George W. Hart][2]. It was heavily inspired by some [old code][3] of
George Hart's that did much the same in VRML.  Additional operators
are being added to increase the range of procedurally generated forms
possible.

One derives any of a vast family of polyhedral shapes by specifying a
core geometric 'seed' and then modifying it with topological and
geometrical operators that derive more complex shapes from this base
set.

It should runs on any modern canvas-enabled browser.

This project was also inspired by the renaissance tome
[Perspectiva Corporum Regularium][4] featuring engravings by Jost
Amman after designs and drawings by Wenzel Jamnitzer.

It is written in coffeescript. Uses jQuery, underscore, [PEG.js][5] parser for parsing recipes, and
[Eli Grey's][eli] BlobBuilder, FileSaver, canvas-toBlob for saving files.

### Future
- Switch rendering to Three.JS
- WebGL frontend to replace the hand-rolled, slow canvas renderer, for
  those browsers that can use it.
- 2d vector export to SVG
- integration of [csg.js][6] lib for complex mesh joins
- geometric distortion operators, i.e.:
```
G x**2,y**2,z**2 => poly.xyz = _.map(poly.xyz, ([x,y,z]) -> [x*x,y*y,z*z])
```
- more geometric refinement operators:
<li><b>F<i>N</i></b> - homogenize <b>F</b>ace area - or at least, prevent faces from getting too small?</li>
<li><b>E<i>N</i></b> - homogenize <b>E</b>dge length</li>
<li><b>B<i>N</i></b> - attempt to <b>B</b>alance F and E, but always enforcing C</li>
- more topological operators:
<li><b>h</b> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternation_%28geometry%29">half</a>
  (symbol clashes with the 'hollow' operator; could change the symbol for hollow to <b>i</b> as in skeletonize?) (caution: requires even-sided faces, and can produce digons)</li>
<li><b>c</b> - chamfer</li>
<li><b>w</b> - whirl</li>
- Simple boolean operations on like-numbered faces: "cut and glue"
- proper touch event handling for mobile
- compounding a series - does it work?
- some documentation on what the palette colors map to. Currently, by "signature",
  which means what exactly?
  - add a UI control to change to this - the other choice is just by vertex count?
- add a few examples to the index page (or a manual page). E.g.
<ul>
  <li>pC - propellerized cube</li>
  <li>tI - truncated icosahedron (soccer ball)</li>
  <li>eptI - exploded propellerized truncated icosahedron</li>
  <li>C300eC200pC200tI - ditto, canonicalized</li>
  <li>AeA3ptI - ditto, with convex spherical adjustment</li>
  To do: give examples using kN or tN, and with a space-delimited series if that's supported.
</ul>
