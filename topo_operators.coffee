# Polyhedron Flagset Construct
#
# A Flag is an associative triple of a face index and two adjacent vertex indices,
# listed in geometric clockwise order (staring into the normal)
#
# Face_i -> V_i -> V_j
#
# They are a useful abstraction for defining topological transformations of the polyhedral mesh, as
# one can refer to vertices and faces that don't yet exist or haven't been traversed yet in the
# transformation code.

# Chamfer
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A truncation along a polyhedron's edges.
# Chamfering or edge-truncation is similar to expansion, moving faces apart and outward,
# but also maintains the original vertices. Adds a new hexagonal face in place of each
# original edge.
# A polyhedron with e edges will have a chamfered form containing 2e new vertices,
# 3e new edges, and e new hexagonal faces. -- Wikipedia
# See also http://dmccooey.com/polyhedra/Chamfer.html
# 
# The dist parameter could control how deeply to chamfer.
# But I'm not sure about implementing that yet.
#
# Q: what is the dual operation of chamfering? I.e.
# if cX = dxdX, and xX = dcdX, what operation is x?

# We could "almost" do this in terms of already-implemented operations:
# cC = t4daC = t4jC, cO = t3daO, cD = t5daD, cI = t3daI
# But it doesn't work for cases like T.
